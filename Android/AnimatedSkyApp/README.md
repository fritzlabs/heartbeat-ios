In this app, we create a simple photo app to replace the sky with an animation.

This example app uses the on-device Image Segmentation API with the Sky Segmentation Model for Android.

## Fritz AI

Fritz AI is the machine learning platform for iOS and Android developers. Teach your mobile apps to see, hear, sense, and think. Start with our ready-to-use feature APIs or connect and deploy your own custom models.

## Requirements

- Android Studio 3.2 or above
- Android device in developer model (USB debugging enabled)

## Getting Started

**Step 1: Create a Fritz AI Account**

[Sign up](https://app.fritz.ai/register) for a free account on Fritz AI in order to get started.

**Step 2: Clone / Fork the fritz-examples repository and open the AnimatedSkyApp app in Android Studio**

```
git clone https://github.com/fritzlabs/fritz-examples.git
```

In Android Studio, choose "Open an existing Android Studio project" and select `AnimatedSkyApp`.

**Step 3: Build the Android Studio Project**

Select "Build > Make Project" from the top nav. Download any missing libraries if applicable. This should sync the gradle dependencies so give the build a second to complete.

**Step 4: Install the app onto your device**

With your Android device connected, select `Run > Run App` from the top nav. When running the app for the first time, you'll have to give permissions to access the camera. After the app is installed and running, take a picture outside and watch as we replace the sky with an animated image.
